**Model Type:** Mart  
**Tags:** `["marts", "polygon", "joined", "options", "stocks"]`  
**Materialization:** Incremental (expected)  

---

## üìò Model Description

The `marts_polygon__stocks_options_joined` model is the **final analytical mart** that joins enriched options data with their corresponding underlying stock metrics from Polygon.io.  
It provides a unified dataset for **options analytics**, **volatility modeling**, and **cross-asset insights**, combining option-level OHLCV measures with stock-level trend indicators (moving averages).

This table serves as the **primary query surface** for dashboards and downstream analysis.

## üß™ Tests

### Column-level tests

| Column | Test | Description |
|--------|------|--------------|
| `option_bar_id` | `unique`, `not_null` | Ensures each record is unique and populated. |
| `option_symbol` | `not_null`, `expect_column_values_to_match_regex` | Validates presence and OCC pattern. |
| `underlying_ticker` | `not_null` | Must match a valid ticker from the underlying stock dataset. |
| `polygon_trade_date`, `expiration_date` | `not_null` | Required temporal keys for modeling and aging. |
| `strike_price`, price and volume fields | `expect_column_values_to_be_between (min_value: 0)` | Ensures valid numeric ranges (no negatives). |
| `option_type` | `accepted_values: ["call", "put"]` | Standardized classification. |
| `moneyness` | `accepted_values: ["in_the_money", "at_the_money", "out_of_the_money"]` | Ensures consistent categorization. |

## üîó Upstream Dependencies

| Source | Dependency Type |
|---------|-----------------|
| `int_polygon__options` | Provides normalized and enriched option bars. |
| `int_polygon__stocks` | Provides derived stock features and technical indicators. |

---

## üß≠ Downstream Use Cases

- **Options analytics dashboards** (Plotly Dash / BI tools)
- **Historical trend studies** on option liquidity and moneyness
- **Cross-asset correlation models** for volatility and momentum research

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Maintenance Notes

- The mart should refresh after upstream `int_polygon__stocks` and `int_polygon__options` finish successfully.
- Range/regex validations are handled upstream; this model enforces only **referential and categorical integrity**.
- Future enhancements may include implied volatility and Greeks once real-time feeds are integrated.
